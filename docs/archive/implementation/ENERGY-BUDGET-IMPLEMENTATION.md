# Energy Budget Feature - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

The energy budget feature has been **fully implemented** with comprehensive tests. Users can now specify an energy budget when submitting messages to guide the AI's energy management for that conversation.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema ✅

Added new column to `conversations` table:
- `energy_budget` (REAL, nullable) - Stores the user-specified energy budget

The system calculates:
- `energyBudgetRemaining` - Budget minus total energy consumed
- `budgetStatus` - 'within', 'exceeded', or 'depleted'

### 2. API Changes ✅

**POST /message** now accepts optional `energyBudget` parameter:

```json
{
  "content": "Your question here",
  "energyBudget": 50
}
```

**Validation:**
- Must be a non-negative number if provided
- Zero is valid (special "last chance" meaning)
- Null/undefined means no budget (default behavior)

**GET /conversations/:requestId** returns budget information:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "totalEnergyConsumed": 25.3,
    "sleepCycles": 2,
    "energyBudget": 50,
    "energyBudgetRemaining": 24.7,
    "budgetStatus": "within"
  }
}
```

### 3. Backend Implementation ✅

**server.ts:**
- Accepts and validates `energyBudget` parameter
- Passes budget to inbox when creating conversation
- Logs budget information in console

**inbox.ts:**
- `addResponse()` - Creates conversation with budget
- `setEnergyBudget()` - Updates budget for existing conversation
- `getRemainingBudget()` - Returns remaining budget
- `getBudgetStatus()` - Returns 'within', 'exceeded', or 'depleted'
- `getConversation()` - Includes budget metadata in response

**loop.ts:**
- Enhanced system message with budget management guidance
- Ephemeral message shows budget status to LLM:
  - Zero budget: "⚠️ CRITICAL: This is your LAST CHANCE to respond"
  - Budget exceeded: "⚠️ Budget exceeded: Try to wrap up efficiently"
  - Budget running low: "⚡ Budget running low: X of Y units remaining"
  - Budget available: "💰 Energy budget: X of Y units remaining"

### 4. LLM Guidance ✅

The AI receives clear guidance about energy budgets:

**System Message:**
```
Energy Budget Management:
- Some conversations may have an energy budget (soft target) specified by the user
- Budget of 0 means this is your LAST CHANCE to respond - make it count
- Budget > 0 means aim to stay within that energy allocation
- No budget means use your normal energy management strategy
- Budget is a SOFT target - prioritize quality over strict adherence
```

**Ephemeral Message:**
Shows real-time budget status with appropriate warnings based on remaining budget.

## Test Coverage ✅

### Integration Tests

**Scenario Tests** (`test/scenarios/`):

1. **Zero Budget** (`zero-budget.ts`):
   - Sends emergency message with budget of 0
   - Verifies AI responds immediately with critical info
   - Checks that conversation may end after response
   - Validates "last chance" behavior

2. **Low Budget** (`low-budget.ts`):
   - Sends simple question with budget of 5 units
   - Verifies AI provides concise response
   - Checks energy consumption stays reasonable
   - Validates response quality

3. **High Budget** (`high-budget.ts`):
   - Sends complex question with budget of 50 units
   - Verifies AI can provide detailed response
   - Checks that budget is utilized effectively
   - Validates comprehensive answers

4. **No Budget** (`no-budget.ts`):
   - Sends message without budget parameter
   - Verifies default behavior (no constraints)
   - Checks that budget fields are null/undefined
   - Validates normal energy management

5. **Budget Exceeded** (`budget-exceeded.ts`):
   - Sends complex question with very low budget (3 units)
   - Verifies AI can exceed budget if necessary (soft limit)
   - Checks budget status becomes "exceeded"
   - Validates quality is maintained

## Running Tests

### Unit Tests (Jest)
```bash
npm test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Run all budget integration tests with auto-managed server
./run-budget-test.sh

# Or manually:
# Terminal 1:
npm start -- --replenish-rate 10 --duration 300

# Terminal 2:
npx ts-node test/run-budget-tests.ts
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Question (Low Budget)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "What is the capital of France?",
    "energyBudget": 5
  }'
```

### Complex Analysis (High Budget)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Explain microservices vs monolithic architecture",
    "energyBudget": 50
  }'
```

### Emergency (Zero Budget)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Server down! What should I check first?",
    "energyBudget": 0
  }'
```

### Normal (No Budget)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Tell me about quantum computing"
  }'
```

## Key Design Decisions

### Soft Limit Approach
The budget is a **soft target**, not a hard limit:
- AI can exceed budget if necessary to provide quality response
- Warnings are shown when budget is low or exceeded
- Quality is prioritized over strict budget adherence

### Zero Budget = Last Chance
Budget of 0 has special meaning:
- Treated as "last chance to respond"
- AI should provide most critical information immediately
- No follow-up responses expected

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing API calls without `energyBudget` work unchanged
- No budget = default behavior (no constraints)
- All existing functionality preserved

### Database Design
- Budget stored as REAL (allows decimals)
- Nullable (null = no budget)
- Remaining budget calculated on-the-fly
- Status derived from budget and consumption

## Behavioral Specifications

### Budget Interpretation

| Budget Value | Behavior |
|--------------|----------|
| **0** | Last chance - provide critical info immediately |
| **1-10** | Low budget - concise, focused responses |
| **11-30** | Medium budget - balanced responses with some detail |
| **31+** | High budget - detailed, comprehensive responses |
| **null/undefined** | No budget - default energy management |

### Budget Status

| Status | Condition | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **within** | remaining > 0 | Under budget, can continue |
| **exceeded** | remaining ≤ 0 (budget > 0) | Over budget, should wrap up |
| **depleted** | budget = 0 | Zero budget (last chance) |
| **null** | No budget set | Default behavior |

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

These were identified in the spec but are out of scope:
- Budget pooling across multiple conversations
- Dynamic budget adjustment based on complexity
- Budget recommendations based on question type
- Budget analytics and reporting
- User-specific budget limits
- Budget presets (quick, normal, detailed)

## Success Criteria ✅

All success criteria from the specification have been met:

- ✅ All unit tests pass
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ API correctly validates budget parameter
- ✅ Database correctly stores and retrieves budget
- ✅ LLM receives accurate budget information
- ✅ Budget tracking is accurate
- ✅ Zero budget conversations are handled appropriately
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Conclusion

The energy budget feature is **fully implemented and tested**. Users can now provide energy budgets to guide the AI's response strategy, from quick concise answers (low budget) to detailed comprehensive analysis (high budget), with special handling for emergency "last chance" scenarios (zero budget).

The implementation follows the soft limit approach, prioritizing response quality while respecting user-specified energy constraints. All existing functionality is preserved, ensuring backward compatibility.

**Status: Ready for production use! 🚀**

# Energy Tracking Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed: Phase 2 - Energy Tracking

### What Was Added

Added energy consumption tracking to the MCP Sub-Agent without modifying the main loop.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Sub-Agent Implementation (`src/mcp-subagent.ts`)

**Added Energy Tracking Fields:**
```typescript
private energyConsumedSinceLastPoll = 0;
private totalEnergyConsumed = 0;
private readonly energyPerSecond = 2; // Energy cost per second of work
```

**Added Public Methods:**
```typescript
getEnergyConsumedSinceLastPoll(): number  // Returns energy, then resets to 0
getTotalEnergyConsumed(): number          // Returns lifetime total
```

**Added Private Method:**
```typescript
trackEnergyConsumption(energy: number): void  // Updates both counters
```

**Integrated into Request Processing:**
- Energy calculated based on actual processing time
- Formula: `energy = processingTime * energyPerSecond`
- Tracked on success AND failure
- No energy consumed when idle

#### 2. Energy Tracking Tests (`test/subagent-energy.test.ts`)

**5 comprehensive tests:**

1. **Basic Energy Tracking** - Single request energy tracking with polling
2. **Multiple Requests Energy** - Cumulative energy across multiple requests
3. **Incremental Polling** - Polling during processing, verifies sum equals total
4. **Energy on Failure** - Energy tracked even when requests fail
5. **Zero Energy When Idle** - No energy consumed without active work

**All 5 tests passing ✅**

#### 3. Test Runner (`run-energy-test.sh`)

Simple script to build and run energy tests:
```bash
./run-energy-test.sh
```

#### 4. Documentation Updates

- Updated `SUB-AGENT-STATUS.md` with Phase 2 completion
- Added success criteria for energy tracking
- Added test commands

### Energy Tracking Design

#### Poll-Based Interface

The main loop can poll for energy consumption:

```typescript
// In main loop's cognitive cycle (every ~few seconds)
const energyUsed = subAgent.getEnergyConsumedSinceLastPoll();
if (energyUsed > 0) {
  energyRegulator.consumeEnergy(energyUsed);
  console.log(`⚡ Sub-agent consumed ${energyUsed} energy`);
}
```

Key benefits:
- **Non-blocking**: Main loop decides when to check
- **Simple**: Just a getter, no callbacks
- **Accurate**: Based on actual work time
- **Automatic reset**: Each poll returns delta, then resets

#### Energy Calculation

```
Energy = ProcessingTime (seconds) × 2 energy/sec
```

Examples:
- 2-second request = 4 energy
- 0.5-second request = 1 energy
- 10-second request = 20 energy

This rate (2 energy/sec) matches the existing system's model generation costs.

#### Incremental Polling

The main loop can poll at any frequency:
- Every cognitive cycle (~5-10 seconds typical)
- During long operations
- On-demand when needed

The sub-agent accumulates energy internally, and each poll:
1. Returns accumulated energy since last poll
2. Resets the counter to 0
3. Total lifetime energy remains in `totalEnergyConsumed`

### Test Results

#### Isolated Tests (Original)
```
./run-subagent-test.sh
==================================================
Test Results: 6/6 passed
==================================================
✅ All tests passed! Sub-agent is ready for integration.
```

#### Energy Tracking Tests (New)
```
./run-energy-test.sh
==================================================
Test Results: 5/5 passed
==================================================
✅ All energy tracking tests passed!
Sub-agent is ready for main loop integration.
```

### What This Enables

With energy tracking complete, the main loop can:

1. **Poll for energy consumption** during cognitive cycles
2. **Deduct from main energy pool** using existing `EnergyRegulator`
3. **Make decisions** about sub-agent work based on energy levels:
   - Pause sub-agent if energy is critical
   - Cancel sub-agent work if needed
   - Prioritize main loop work over sub-agent work

### Example Integration (Not Implemented Yet)

```typescript
// In SensitiveLoop.unifiedCognitiveAction()
private async unifiedCognitiveAction() {
  // Check sub-agent energy consumption
  const subAgentEnergy = this.subAgent.getEnergyConsumedSinceLastPoll();
  if (subAgentEnergy > 0) {
    this.energyRegulator.consumeEnergy(subAgentEnergy);
    console.log(`⚡ Sub-agent consumed ${subAgentEnergy.toFixed(1)} energy`);
  }
  
  // Check if sub-agent has messages
  const messages = this.subAgent.pollMessages();
  for (const msg of messages) {
    // Handle completion, status updates, errors
    this.handleSubAgentMessage(msg);
  }
  
  // Rest of cognitive action...
}
```

1. `020eecc` - feat(mcp): add isolated sub-agent with comprehensive tests
2. `31ed22c` - feat(mcp): add energy tracking to sub-agent

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 3: Main Loop Integration

**Goal**: Integrate the sub-agent with the sensitive loop

**Tasks**:
1. Add sub-agent instance to `SensitiveLoop` class
2. Start sub-agent when loop starts
3. Poll for energy during cognitive cycles
4. Deduct energy from main regulator
5. Poll for messages and handle them
6. Test end-to-end integration

**Files to modify**:
- `src/loop.ts` - Add sub-agent integration
- Create: `src/subagent-interface.ts` - Wrapper/helper for integration
- Add integration test

**Estimated effort**: 3-4 hours

**Success criteria**:
- Sub-agent starts with main loop
- Energy is deducted from main pool
- Main loop remains responsive
- Messages are received and logged
- System runs end-to-end without errors

### Phase 4: LLM Tool Exposure

After main loop integration, expose sub-agent to LLM via tools.

### Phase 5: Real MCP Implementation

Replace mock handlers with actual MCP server operations.

## 🔍 Verification

To verify energy tracking works:

```bash
# Run energy tests
./run-energy-test.sh

# Verify output shows:
# - Energy consumption for each request
# - Correct totals
# - Zero energy when idle
# - Proper polling behavior
```

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Energy rate of 2 energy/sec** matches LLM call costs in existing system
2. **Poll-based (not push)** keeps interface simple and non-blocking
3. **Auto-reset on poll** prevents double-counting
4. **Track on failure** ensures all work costs energy
5. **No energy when idle** - sub-agent loop itself is negligible cost

### No Changes to Main Loop Yet

This implementation is **completely isolated** from the main loop:
- No modifications to `src/loop.ts`
- No modifications to `src/energy.ts`
- No modifications to existing tools
- Can be tested independently

### Ready for Integration

The sub-agent is now ready to be integrated with the main loop. The interface is stable and tested.

## 🎉 Achievements

- ✅ Energy tracking implemented
- ✅ All tests passing (11/11)
- ✅ Zero disruption to existing code
- ✅ Clean, testable interface
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Ready for next phase

The sub-agent can now accurately report its energy consumption to the main loop without any blocking or complexity!

# Fixes Applied - New User Experience Improvements

## Date
October 11, 2025

## Summary
Fixed critical configuration inconsistencies and usability issues identified in NEW-USER-FEEDBACK.md that would prevent new users from successfully setting up and running the system.

---

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Port Number Consistency
**Issue**: Port number was inconsistent across documentation and configuration files
- README said port 6740
- Architecture diagram said port 3002
- .env.example said port 3002

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `.env.example` to use port 6740 (matches code default)
- Updated README architecture diagram to show port 6740
- All documentation now consistently uses port 6740

**Files Modified**:
- `.env.example` line 2
- `README.md` line 30

---

### 2. ✅ OLLAMA_BASE_URL Clarity
**Issue**: Confusion about whether to use `/v1` suffix
- README showed: `http://localhost:11434`
- .env.example showed: `http://localhost:11434/v1`
- Code adds `/v1` automatically

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `.env.example` to use `http://localhost:11434` (without /v1)
- Added clear comment explaining that /v1 is added automatically by the system
- Removed confusing OLLAMA_API_KEY from .env.example (not needed for local Ollama)

**Files Modified**:
- `.env.example` lines 4-6

---

### 3. ✅ Clear Setup Instructions
**Issue**: Missing explicit .env file creation step

**Fix Applied**:
- Added clear "Step 1: Create your environment file" section
- Shows `cp .env.example .env` command explicitly
- Explains what the defaults are
- Makes it clear this is required

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` lines 74-91

---

### 4. ✅ Model Installation Clarity
**Issue**: Not clear that models are required, no size/time information

**Fix Applied**:
- Added warning emoji and "Downloads ~3GB, may take 5-10 minutes"
- Showed exact sizes for each model
- Added verification step with expected output
- Made it clear these are REQUIRED for system to work

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` lines 114-129

---

### 5. ✅ Setup Verification Script
**Issue**: No way to verify setup before starting

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `verify-setup.sh` script that checks:
  - Node.js version (18+)
  - Ollama installation and running status
  - Required models installed
  - .env file exists
  - Dependencies installed
  - Project built
- Provides color-coded output (errors in red, warnings in yellow, success in green)
- Gives actionable error messages

**Files Created**:
- `verify-setup.sh` (executable)

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` - Added Step 3: Verify your setup

---

### 6. ✅ Expected Output Documentation
**Issue**: Users don't know what success looks like

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "✅ Success! You should see:" section
- Shows exact console output users should expect
- Lists all access URLs clearly
- Distinguishes between Monitor UI, REST API, and WebSocket

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` lines 162-172

---

### 7. ✅ Troubleshooting Section
**Issue**: No troubleshooting guidance for common errors

**Fix Applied**:
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting section with:
  - "Cannot find module" errors
  - "ECONNREFUSED" (Ollama not running)
  - "Model not found" errors
  - Port already in use
  - System starts but no responses
  - Missing environment variables
  - Build errors
- Each issue has clear cause and solution

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` lines 594-657

---

### 8. ✅ Prerequisites Check Section
**Issue**: No way to verify prerequisites before installation

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "Prerequisites Check" section before installation
- Shows quick commands to verify Node.js, Ollama, and Ollama status
- Helps users catch issues early

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` lines 58-67

---

## Previous Fixes (From Earlier Session)

### 1. ❌ Approval Endpoints Returning 404
**Issue**: The approval endpoints were defined in the code but returning 404 errors when accessed.

**Root Cause**: The catch-all route for the SPA was not including `/apps` in its API route whitelist, and the route ordering could cause issues.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `/apps` to the API route whitelist in the catch-all handler
- Improved error handling when index.html doesn't exist
- Added better comments for route ordering

**Location**: `src/server.ts` lines 797-827

**Before**:
```typescript
app.get('*', (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/conversations') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/stats') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/health') ||
      req.path.startsWith('/message')) {
    next();
  } else {
    // serve index.html
  }
});
```

**After**:
```typescript
app.get('*', (req, res, next) => {
  // Skip catch-all for API routes
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/conversations') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/stats') || 
      req.path.startsWith('/health') ||
      req.path.startsWith('/message') ||
      req.path.startsWith('/apps')) {
    next();
  } else {
    const indexPath = path.join(__dirname, '../../ui/dist/index.html');
    res.sendFile(indexPath, (err) => {
      if (err) {
        // If index.html doesn't exist, return API info
        res.json({
          name: 'AI Effort Regulation API',
          version: '1.0.0',
          documentation: '/api-docs',
          endpoints: {
            health: 'GET /health',
            stats: 'GET /stats',
            message: 'POST /message',
            conversations: 'GET /conversations',
            apps: 'GET /apps'
          }
        });
      }
    });
  }
});
```

**Testing Required**: 
Server restart needed to apply changes. Test with:
```bash
curl http://localhost:6740/conversations/test-conv-1/approvals
curl http://localhost:6740/apps
curl http://localhost:6740/apps/chat/energy
```

---

### 2. ⚠️ WebSocket Endpoint Path
**Issue**: WebSocket test returned 404 when connecting to `ws://localhost:6740/ws`

**Status**: Needs investigation - WebSocket server is initialized with path `/ws` in code

**Possible Causes**:
1. WebSocket server might not be properly attached to HTTP server
2. Path configuration might need adjustment
3. Server restart required to activate WebSocket

**Code Location**: `src/server.ts` line 787
```typescript
const wss = new WSServer({ server, path: '/ws' });
```

**Testing Required**:
After server restart, test with:
```bash
node websocket-test.js
```

---

### 3. ℹ️ API Documentation Endpoint
**Issue**: Some endpoints were returning HTML errors instead of JSON

**Status**: Fixed as part of catch-all route improvement

**Improvement**: Added fallback JSON response when UI files are missing

---

## How to Apply Fixes

### Step 1: Rebuild
```bash
cd /home/nicolas/Source/ai-effort-regulation
npm run build:backend
```

### Step 2: Restart Server
The running server needs to be restarted to pick up the changes:
```bash
# Find and stop the current server
pkill -f "node dist/src/index.js"

# Or if using npm start
# Ctrl+C in the terminal running the server

# Start fresh
npm start
```

### Step 3: Verify Fixes
Run the verification script:
```bash
bash verify-fixes.sh
```

---

## Test Scripts Created

1. **creative-user-test.sh** - Comprehensive API testing
2. **websocket-test.js** - WebSocket connection testing
3. **approval-test.sh** - Approval system testing
4. **comprehensive-test-report.sh** - Full system test
5. **verify-fixes.sh** - Verification script (to be created)

---

## Additional Improvements Made

### Better Error Handling
- Improved fallback when UI files are missing
- Better API route detection in catch-all handler
- More informative error responses

### Documentation
- Added comments explaining route ordering
- Clarified API route whitelist purpose
- Documented fix process

---

## Files Modified

1. `/home/nicolas/Source/ai-effort-regulation/src/server.ts`
   - Lines 794-827: Route ordering and API whitelist

---

## Verification Checklist

After server restart, verify:

- [ ] `/conversations/:id/approvals` returns JSON (not 404)
- [ ] `/conversations/:id/approve` accepts POST requests
- [ ] `/conversations/:id/reject` accepts POST requests
- [ ] `/apps` endpoint returns app list
- [ ] `/apps/:id/energy` returns energy metrics
- [ ] WebSocket connection to `/ws` succeeds
- [ ] Root path `/` returns UI or API info
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

---

## Notes

- Changes are backward compatible
- No breaking changes to API
- Server restart required for changes to take effect
- All tests should pass after restart

---

## Next Steps

1. Restart the server
2. Run verification tests
3. Test WebSocket functionality
4. Test approval system endpoints
5. Verify UI still loads correctly

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixes applied and built, awaiting server restart for verification

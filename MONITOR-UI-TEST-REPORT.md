5. **Logging**: Add client-side error logging
6. **Analytics**: Track usage patterns

### For Future Enhancements

1. **Event Filtering**: Add ability to filter events by type
2. **Conversation Search**: Search through conversation list
3. **Export**: Export conversation data
4. **Playback**: Replay past events
5. **Metrics Dashboard**: Add charts and graphs
6. **Multi-User**: Show connected users

## Conclusion

The Monitor UI is **production-ready** for its intended use case (development and demonstration tool). All core functionality works correctly:

✅ **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time, bidirectional, reliable  
✅ **UI Rendering**: All components present and functional  
✅ **Message Sending**: Works perfectly with event broadcasting  
✅ **Energy Monitoring**: Real-time updates with visual feedback  
✅ **Event Streaming**: Color-coded, auto-scrolling, comprehensive  
✅ **Performance**: Fast, smooth, no lag  
✅ **Error Handling**: No errors detected  

The implementation successfully transforms the AI Effort Regulation system from a "black box" into a transparent, observable platform. The UI provides excellent visibility into the system's cognitive processes and is ready for use in development, debugging, and demonstrations.

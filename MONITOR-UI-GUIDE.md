**Solutions**:
1. Check WebSocket connection status
2. Verify backend is processing messages
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Refresh the page to reconnect

### Conversations Not Loading

**Symptoms**:
- Conversation List empty
- "No conversations yet" message

**Solutions**:
1. Send a test message to create a conversation
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Verify database is accessible
4. Check REST API: `curl http://localhost:6740/conversations`

### UI Not Updating

**Symptoms**:
- Stale data
- No real-time updates

**Solutions**:
1. Check WebSocket connection
2. Refresh the page
3. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify backend is broadcasting events

## Technical Details

### WebSocket Protocol

The Monitor UI uses WebSocket for bi-directional communication:

**Client → Server**:
- `send_message`: Send new message
- `get_conversations`: Request conversation list
- `get_conversation`: Request conversation detail
- `get_stats`: Request system statistics

**Server → Client** (Broadcasts):
- `connected`: Connection established
- `energy_update`: Energy level changed
- `conversation_created`: New conversation
- `message_added`: New message
- `conversation_state_changed`: State transition
- `model_switched`: Model change
- `sleep_start`/`sleep_end`: Sleep cycles
- `tool_invocation`: Tool called
- `system_stats`: Statistics update
- `error`: Error occurred

### Data Flow

1. User sends message via UI
2. WebSocket sends `send_message` to server
3. Server creates conversation via existing API
4. SensitiveLoop processes message
5. EventBridge broadcasts events:
   - `conversation_created`
   - `message_added` (for each response)
   - `energy_update` (as energy changes)
6. All connected clients receive updates
7. UI updates in real-time

### Performance

- **WebSocket Latency**: < 50ms
- **UI Update Rate**: 60fps
- **Event History**: Last 100 events
- **Reconnection**: Automatic with exponential backoff
- **Memory**: Minimal, events are not persisted

## Best Practices

### For Monitoring

1. **Keep Event Stream visible** to catch important events
2. **Watch Energy Gauge** to understand system state
3. **Use energy budgets** to guide AI effort
4. **Review conversation metadata** to understand behavior

### For Demonstrations

1. **Start with full energy** for predictable behavior
2. **Use varied budgets** to show adaptability
3. **Point out Event Stream** to show transparency
4. **Explain energy colors** (green/yellow/orange/red)
5. **Show model switches** as energy decreases

### For Development

1. **Use dev mode** (`npm run dev:frontend`) for hot-reload
2. **Check browser console** for errors
3. **Monitor backend logs** for server-side issues
4. **Test WebSocket reconnection** by restarting backend

## Advanced Features

### Multiple Clients

Multiple browser tabs/windows can connect simultaneously:
- All clients receive the same broadcasts
- Each client can send messages independently
- Useful for multi-user demonstrations

### Event Filtering (Future)

Planned feature to filter events by type:
- Show only energy updates
- Show only conversation events
- Show only errors

### Playback Mode (Future)

Planned feature to replay past events:
- Record event stream
- Replay at different speeds
- Useful for analysis and presentations

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Authentication**: Anyone with network access can connect
2. **No Event Persistence**: Events lost on page refresh
3. **No Event Filtering**: All events shown
4. **No Multi-User Indicators**: Can't see other connected users
5. **No Configuration UI**: Settings must be changed via code/env

### Design Limitations

1. **Development Tool**: Not designed for production end-users
2. **Single System**: Monitors one backend instance only
3. **No Historical Data**: Only shows current session
4. **No Metrics Dashboard**: No charts or graphs (yet)

## Security Considerations

### Development Use Only

The Monitor UI is designed for development and demonstration:
- **No authentication required**
- **No rate limiting on WebSocket**
- **No data encryption** (use HTTPS in production)
- **Full system visibility** (all events broadcast)

### Production Deployment

If deploying to production:
1. Add authentication (OAuth, JWT, etc.)
2. Use HTTPS/WSS for encryption
3. Add rate limiting
4. Implement access controls
5. Consider user-specific views
6. Add audit logging

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this in production?**
A: The Monitor UI is designed for development and demonstrations. For production, add authentication, encryption, and access controls.

**Q: Why isn't my conversation updating?**
A: Check WebSocket connection status. If disconnected, refresh the page. If still not working, check backend logs.

**Q: Can I see past conversations?**
A: Yes, the Conversation List shows all conversations in the database. Click any conversation to view its history.

**Q: What's the difference between the Monitor UI and the REST API?**
A: The REST API is for programmatic access. The Monitor UI provides a visual, real-time interface for humans.

**Q: Can I customize the UI?**
A: Yes! The UI is built with React and TailwindCSS. Modify the components in `ui/src/components/`.

**Q: Does the Monitor UI affect system performance?**
A: Minimal impact. WebSocket broadcasts are efficient, and the UI only keeps the last 100 events in memory.

**Q: Can I export conversation data?**
A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature. Currently, use the REST API: `GET /conversations/:id`

**Q: Why do I see duplicate events?**
A: This can happen if multiple browser tabs are open. Each tab receives all broadcasts independently.

**Q: Can I disable the Monitor UI?**
A: The WebSocket server runs automatically. To disable, remove the WebSocket initialization from `src/index.ts`.
